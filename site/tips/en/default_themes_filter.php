<h1>Default Themes filter</h1>

A Theme can be easily reused in any program environment, but in many situations a user-created Theme has a specific use in a program's functionality.<br />
To facilitate the organization, it is possible to define a standard filter so that the list of themes in the different features of the program only shows the items that you define for that feature.<br />
<br />
To do this you need to organize the themes by tags and then define which tags are accepted in each functionality.<br />
<br />
Example: Create a tag with the name "Verses" (theme menu, tags) and add all the themes you created to display verses in that tag.<br />
And then access the theme menu, filter, select the <b>Bible</b> tab and select the "Verses" tag <br />
<br />
This way only the topics marked with the tag "Verses" will be listed in the Bible window<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b><br />
If you activate the filter, whenever you create a new theme, remember to add the corresponding tag so that the theme is listed correctly. <br />
