Slow opening the program or projecting videos/images.
Some themes do not open or are disfigured.
Program slows down, memory full.
--------
Not only is the memory shortage that causes the program to crash, it may be the low performance processor, lack of graphics card, antivirus, heavy video.

Possible settings to make program work better:
<ul>
  <li>File menu, settings, disable fade in/out.</li>
  <li>File menu, display settings, disable transition effects.</li>
  <li>Do not use font size over 20 in themes.</li>
  <li>Add the program folder to the list of antivirus exceptions installed on your computer and/or Windows Defender: <b>C:/Holyrics</b></li>
  <li>Decrease projection screen resolution, the smaller the lighter.</li>
  <li>If your computer is not properly configured, avoid using video theme. It's best to use theme with image and the program works well.</li>
</ul>
In addition to these alternatives, only upgrading the computer hardware.
