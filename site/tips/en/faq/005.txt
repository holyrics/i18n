Is it possible to place the image of a camera/webcam in Holyrics?
--------
<b>Camera IP</b>
See camera settings for access link to paste in Holyrics VLC player.
For example: http://192.168.0.123:8080/video
Insert the link into the "globe" icon on the VLC player near the volume.
After inserting the link, press the <b>play</b> icon to execute in the projection.

<b>WebCam</b>
Use the shortcut on the "3 dots" of VLC Player, <b>webcam</b> option:

<b>Note:</b> Camera video playback may have a long delay between the received image and projection playback.
A recommended alternative is to use a specific capture software to display the camera image on projection.
A software that will be more efficient and have less delay.
And then you use Holyrics just to display the text over the video.
An example software would be OBS Studio <b>OBS Studio</b>.
