Is it possible to use panoramic projection (with more than one datashow) with Hoyrics?
--------
Panoramic projection is the projection made by joining two or more projectors to form a "super wide screen".
Many people believe that this type of projection is not possible with Holyrics because the program itself does not provide edge blending capability.
However, the screens do not have to be joined exclusively by projection software, but can be done with any third party software or even with specific hardware.
