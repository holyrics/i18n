Set up stage view (return monitor)
--------
To use return monitor as standalone screen the computer must have 3 video outputs, or 2, in case of notebook.

On PC:
- one output to the user monitor;
- one output to projector;
- one output to stage view (return monitor).

On notebook:
- one output to projector;
- one output to stage view (return monitor).

With all cables plugged in, configure Windows with 3 screens in extended mode.
The program will automatically identify the screens and it is possible to use return monitor.

Note: Some video graphics cards, even with 3 outputs, do not allow all 3 to be used at the same time.
Also notebook with 2 outputs that allows you to use only one at a time.
That is, you need to test the outputs to make sure your PC or notebook supports it.

Alternatives for PCs or Notebooks that don't have enough video outputs:
- Return via wifi if the return screen is a smart tv (see <a href='#q017'>faq 17</a>).

- USB/VGA adapter or USB/HDMI adapter to turn a USB output into video output.
After plugging in the adapter and installing the drivers, you only set the extended mode display in Windows settings.

Note: Check adapter specifications to see if it is compatible with your computer.
Turning a USB output into video output can overload the computer's processor.
