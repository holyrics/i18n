Download and install the 64-bit version of the program (<a href='/download.html'>download</a>).
Note: It is not necessary to uninstall the current version. The data will be kept after installation.

If the problem persists:
In the <b>My Videos</b> tab you can click on the "three dots" of a video that is not playing correctly and click on edit properties.
Check the resolution and the bitrate.

Resolutions greater than or equal to 1920x1080 and bitrates above 5000 may overload the PC and cause videos not to play correctly.
You can lower the resolution and bitrate to make a test.
Use about 1280x720 for size and about 4000 for bitrate.
