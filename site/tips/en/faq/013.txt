Problem connecting mobile app with notebook/computer.
Application showing connection failure error - Holyrics not found on network.
--------
<b>Android</b>
Usually synchronization is automatic.
As long as your computer and phone are on the same wifi network.
Any problems communicating, click the solve button and follow the directions.
After reading qrcode, if the <b>PING</b> item fails, in most cases the problem is:
- phone and computer are not on the same network;
- or the network router is blocking communication through a firewall or feature called <b>client isolation</b>. Access your router settings to try to solve the problem.

If an error message appears when you click to open the qrcode window on your computer, the problem is usually the antivirus firewall installed on the computer blocking the software.
Add the program to the <b>antivirus firewall</b> exception list.

<b>iOS</b>
In computer software, go to tools menu, change webservice address;
Enter the IP that appears in the <b>Computer IP</b> field.
If continue with error, in the computer program open the help menu, app connection failure, click yes if asked to execute a code;
After a window with qr code appears, you can close it and try again from the app.
