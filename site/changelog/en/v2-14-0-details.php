<b>[Telegram] 'Draw Lots', 'Poll' and 'Questions' features via Telegram</b>
It is possible to create these events in the program so that people can participate using Telegram itself.
Participation is done using the chat <a href='https://t.me/HolyricsBot' target='_blank'>@HolyricsBot</a>.
For example, create a poll through the program and tell participants the name of the poll.
People will be able to vote by accessing the chat and you will be able to display the result in real time on the projection.


<b>[Presentation Footer] Change Theme functionality with option to change only current song when playing playlist</b>
In the presentation footer, when playing a playlist and changing the theme or background of slides during the presentation, all slides are changed by default.
This option allows you to change the default operation to change only the slides of the currently playing music.


<b>[MIDI] Option to display the main window presentation footer when starting a presentation</b>
When starting a presentation remotely (as commands via MIDI) the presentation footer in the main program window is not displayed.
Added an option in the MIDI window settings for the footer to be displayed when playing a song and to be controlled by the user if necessary.
