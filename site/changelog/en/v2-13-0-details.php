<b>[Wallpaper] Set a wallpaper for each searvice (file menu, settings)</b>
When setting a wallpaper for a service, the program will automatically use the service wallpaper selected in the main window's playlist.
If there is no wallpaper set for the selected service, or if the <b>temporary</b> playlist is selected, the default wallpaper will be used.
Note: The wallpaper displayed is not according to the <b>time of service</b>, but according to the service selected in the <b>playlist</b> of the main window.
Note: It is also possible to set a wallpaper for each service in the <b>wallpaper</b> option of the bookmarks bar.


<b>[Schedule] Filter members for each role</b>
When editing the scale in role mode, the list of users that appear for each role is based on the group defined for the member and role, for example:
If the <b>guitar</b> role is defined as the <b>instrument</b> group, all members of the <b>instrument</b> group appear in the list to be assigned to the <b>guitar</b> role.
It is now possible to define which users of the <b>instrument</b> group will appear in the list to be cast in the <b>guitar</b> role.


<b>[Media] Basic audio, video and image editing</b>
Some editing tools will be available by right-clicking a media item in the main window tabs.
It will also be available in the tools menu, several.


<b>[Video] Workaround to play videos with rotation not identified by the program</b>
Some videos (generally recorded by mobile) do not play correctly in the program as VLC Player does not identify the video rotation setting.
A workaround has been implemented to avoid this unforeseen event, as in many cases this is only repaired at the time of use.
If the program identifies that the video has a rotation setting defined in the "metadata" of the file, the video will be played <b>externally</b> by VLC Player directly in the operating system.


<b>Option to add a video as a slide background without using the "my videos" tab</b>
In the music editing window, to set a video as the background for a slide, you must first add it to the <b>My Videos</b> tab in the Themes background list.
It is now possible to set a specific video as the background of a slide without adding it in the <b>My Videos</b> tab.
Just drag the video file from the operating system folder (Windows Explorer, for example) to the top of the slide.
Note: Recommended only if you want to use a specific video for a particular slide.
If the video will be reused in other slides of other songs, it is still recommended to add it in the <b>My Videos</b> tab.
