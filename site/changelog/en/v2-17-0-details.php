<b>(Stage View) View all music slides</b>
Option to display the entire text of the song being performed on the return screen.
You can also set different formatting for the current slide in view (or other slides).
That way, even with the full text being displayed on the return screen, the portion of the slide currently being displayed will be highlighted.


<b>[PowerPoint] Quick verse display</b>
Option to be able to display a Bible verse in the projection without having to end the PowerPoint presentation being displayed by Holyrics.
This can be done from the main window's presentation footer, by clicking on the <b>'show verse'</b> button.

To make it easier, the program automatically tries to identify some reference within each slide.
In this way, in the presentation footer, by right-clicking on a slide that has some biblical reference, a shortcut will appear to display the particular verse.
For example: If on the slide somewhere it says <b><i>John 3:16</i></b> or <b><i>Romans 12:2</i></b>, then you can right-clicking on this slide in the footer of the presentation will show the option "Automatic Presentation" and the verse in the list of items to display.
