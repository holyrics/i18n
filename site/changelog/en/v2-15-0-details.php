<b>Translate (manually) slides of a song or text</b>
It is possible to create translations for each slide of a song in a simple way.
Once translated, display the original text on the main projection and the translated text on <b>another screen</b> or multiple translations on the same screen.
To use this feature it is necessary to access the advanced editor in the music/text editing window.
